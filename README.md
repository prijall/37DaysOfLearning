<h1>Day 1</h1> 
<b>Today, I deep dive into the basic concept of Matplotlib which is one of the most important Python libraries for data visualization.  
It helps to convert the given data into visuals like graphs, bar graphs, pie-chart, etc
</b>

<h1>Day 3</h1>
<b>After having some basic insight into matplotlib, I have started learning about TensorFlow. TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Since my device had an issue with installation with tensor, I did basic on Google Collab and learned about basic initialization on tensorflow.</b>

<h1>Day 5</h1>
<b>Today, I decided to learn scikit learn instead of tensorflow as I am a beginner at machine learning. scikit-learn is a free software machine-learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy, etc</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 6</h1>
<b>Today, I practiced the basics of scikit learn and learned to import datasets from sklearn itself. Similarly, I grasped little knowledge of Linear Regression and what it is used.
  <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression:</li>
    <p>It is used to model a single independent variable and a continuous dependent variable variable.</p>

<h1>Day 7</h1>
<b>From today, I decided to halt my scikit-learn journey and I again started to learn Python for AI and data science from Coursera. I felt like my concept in Python was weaker so I am again practicing it.</b>
<br/>

<h1>Day 8</h1>
<b>Today, I practised about dictionary in Python which is one of the important data structures. </b>
<br/>

<h1>Day 9</h1>
<b>Today, I practised about sets from Coursera. Sets are similar to that of list but it doesn't have any index. Sets are also written in curly braces. This was the last topic in data structures in Python. It seems to be helpful.</b>

<h1>Day 13</h1>
<b>Today, I learned about Pandas, which is one of the most important libraries based on Python for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas is built around data structures called Series and DataFrames. Data for these collections can be imported from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, Parquet, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel.</b>

<h1>Day 14</h1>
<b>NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays, linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it is an open source project. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.NumPy is usually imported under the np alias.</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 15</h1>
<b>NumPy is a Python library that supports large multidimensional arrays and matrices, with high-level mathematical functions to operate these arrays. NumPy arrays are fast compared to traditional lists because they use fixed datatype and contiguous memory allocation. NumPy 2D arrays are an array within an array, representing a table with rows and columns of data. The number of dimensions and items in an array is defined by its shape, which is a tuple of N non-negative integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. The type of items in the array is specified by a separate data-type object (dtype), one of which is associated with each ndarray.</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 16</h1>
<b>Today, I learned about API in Python Programming for AI/Data Science. An API lets two pieces of software talk to each other. Just like a function, you don't have to know how the API works, only its inputs and outputs.  An essential type of API is a REST API that allows you to access resources via the internet. In this lab, we will review the Pandas Library in the context of an API, we will also review a basic REST API.</b>
<br/>

<h1>Day 17</h1>
<b>Today, I got to learn about web scraping using the Python library Beautiful Soup, which is one of the phenomenal libraries in Python. Web scraping is important in the sense that it helps to extract data from web pages into our program. we need to have basic knowledge of Python loops and functions and import a beautiful soup library. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, a  focus is on HTML files. This is accomplished by representing the HTML as a set of objects with methods used to parse the HTML. We can navigate the HTML as a tree, and/or filter out what we are looking for. Knowing HTML is very beneficial.</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 18</h1>
<b>Today, I learned about different types of file types and understand their different meaning along with their usage. A file format is a standard way in which information is encoded for storage in a file. First, the file format specifies whether the file is a binary or ASCII file. Second, it shows how the information is organized. For example, the comma-separated values (CSV) file format stores tabular data in plain text. To identify a file format, you can usually look at the file extension to get an idea. For example, a file saved with the name "Data" in "CSV" format will appear as Data.csv. By noticing the .csv extension, we can identify that it is a CSV file and the data is stored in a tabular format.</b>

<h1>Day 20</h1>
<b>Today, I learned to back up the database using query and also grasp the ideas in SQL constraints which are very important to learn. Similarly, I learned about parameters like group by and having which are used with where and without where resp. </b>
