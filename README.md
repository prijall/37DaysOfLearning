<h1>Day 1</h1> 
<b>Today, I deep dive into the basic concept of Matplotlib which is one of the most important Python libraries for data visualization.  
It helps to convert the given data into visuals like graphs, bar graphs, pie-chart, etc

<br/>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<b>Getting into Matplotlib, I learned about the different visualization graphs that help make our data clearer. Similarly, today I learned to use functions to make various graphs, which is very convenient to use </b>

<h1>Day 3</h1>
<b>After having some basic insight on matplotlib, now i started learning about tensorflow. TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Since, my device had an issue with installation with tensor, i did basic on Google collab and learnt about basic initialization on tensorflow.</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 4</h1>
<b>Today, I just did some basic mathematical manipulations on tensorflow and learnt about tensor indexing and reshaping. Similarly, today i got to know about keras and its implementation on tensorflow to build machine learning model. Excited about it</b>

<h1>Day 5</h1>
<b>Today, I decided to learn scikit learn instead of tensorflow as i am beginner to machine learning. scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy,etc</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 6</h1>
<b>Today, I practised the basics of scikit learn and learnt to import datasets from sklearn itself. Similarly, I grasped little knowledge on Linear Regression and to what it is used.
  <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression:</li>
    <p>It is used to model single independent variable and a continuous dependent variable variable.</p>

<br/>

<h1>Day 7</h1>
<b>From today, I decided to halt my scikit-learn journey and i again start to learn python for AI and data science from coursera. I felt like my concept in python is weeker so i am again practicing it.</b>
<br/>

<h1>Day 8</h1>
<b>Today, I practised about dictionary in python which is one of the important data structures. </b>
<br/>

<h1>Day 9</h1>
<b>Today, I practised about sets from coursera. Sets are similar to that of list but it doestnot have any index. Sets are also wriiten in curly braces. This was the last topic in data structures in python. It really seems to be helpful.</b>

<h1>Day 10</h1>
<b>In the morning itself, i did my week 3rd course on coursera. Today, i learned about condition and branching in python. I grasped the concept of range function as well.  Day by day the concepts are getting harder but its always fun to learn new things.</b>

<h1>Day 11</h1>
<b>Learning about the function is very fun and valuable as it provides the pwerful usecase of python programmimg. Similarly, by using coursera, i did some exercise on python for AI and data science.</b>

<h1>Day 12</h1>
<b>From  Coursera, i practised about object and classes in python programming. It is the basic concept and most important concept of object oriented programming. The usecase of oop in data science is use and is very important.</b>
