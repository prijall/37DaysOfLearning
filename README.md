<h1>Day 15</h1>
<b>NumPy is a Python library that supports large multidimensional arrays and matrices, with high-level mathematical functions to operate these arrays. NumPy arrays are fast compared to traditional lists because they use fixed datatype and contiguous memory allocation. NumPy 2D arrays are an array within an array, representing a table with rows and columns of data. The number of dimensions and items in an array is defined by its shape, which is a tuple of N non-negative integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. The type of items in the array is specified by a separate data-type object (dtype), one of which is associated with each ndarray.</b>

<h1>Day 16</h1>
<b>Today, I learned about API in Python Programming for AI/Data Science. An API lets two pieces of software talk to each other. Just like a function, you don't have to know how the API works, only its inputs and outputs.  An essential type of API is a REST API that allows you to access resources via the internet. In this lab, we will review the Pandas Library in the context of an API, we will also review a basic REST API.</b>
<br/>

<h1>Day 17</h1>
<b>Today, I got to learn about web scraping using the Python library Beautiful Soup, which is one of the phenomenal libraries in Python. Web scraping is important in the sense that it helps to extract data from web pages into our program. we need to have basic knowledge of Python loops and functions and import a beautiful soup library. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, a  focus is on HTML files. This is accomplished by representing the HTML as a set of objects with methods used to parse the HTML. We can navigate the HTML as a tree, and/or filter out what we are looking for. Knowing HTML is very beneficial.</b>

<h1>Day 18</h1>
<b>Today, I learned about different types of file types and understand their different meaning along with their usage. A file format is a standard way in which information is encoded for storage in a file. First, the file format specifies whether the file is a binary or ASCII file. Second, it shows how the information is organized. For example, the comma-separated values (CSV) file format stores tabular data in plain text. To identify a file format, you can usually look at the file extension to get an idea. For example, a file saved with the name "Data" in "CSV" format will appear as Data.csv. By noticing the .csv extension, we can identify that it is a CSV file and the data is stored in a tabular format.</b>

<h1>Day 24</h1>
<b>From Krish Naik's video of simple linear regression, I built a California housing price prediction using simple linear regression. This wasn't the end-to-end project of Machine Learning Algorithms but just the overlook of how the hypothesis model/ML model is built on top of these concepts.

<br/>

<h1>Day 25</h1>
<b>From today, I have devoted myself to learning machine learning algorithms for my machine learning journey. Continuing Krish Naik's video on simple linear regression, today I learned about the cost/loss function which is one of the important factors in defining the best-fit line.
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Residual Error:</h3> When the summation of the difference between predicted values and actual value in (x,y) coordinate.</li>
    <li><h3>Cost Function:</h3> The cost function measures the difference between the predicted values of the model and the actual target values</li>
    <li><h3>Best-Fit line:</h3> It is a linear line in a graph built based on a cost function where the residual error is minimum.</li>
  </ul>

</br>

<h1>Day 26</h1>
<b>Today, I watched the lecture on mean squared value, and mean absolute value from Krish Naik's video and got insightful knowledge about their use case in simple linear regression.<ul>
  <li><h3>MEAN SQUARED ERROR:</h3> The squared average of the difference between the predicted value and actual value. The main advantages of MSE are: that it is differentiable and has single local maxima. The main disadvantage is that it is not robust to outliners.</li>
<li><h3>MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR:</h3> The average difference between the predicted value and absolute value in a mod. The advantages are: It is robust to outliner. The disadvantage is that it takes more time in convergence as it doesn't form gradient descent.</li>
</ul></b>

</br>

<h1>Day 27</h1>
<b>One of the initial doubts during the starting of linear regression was about the concept of overfitting. From Krish Naik's video, Today, I came to know about the overfitting condition in linear regression and how to handle it.<br/> <h3>Overfiiting:</h3>When the best-fit line passes through each actual value so that the cost function is equivalent to zero. 
<h3>The ways to handle overfitting are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ridge Regression</li>
    <li>Lasso Regression</li>
  </ul>
  More about them Tomorrow.

<br/>

<h1>Day 28</h1>
<b>After learning about the best fit line, and condition of overfitting, Today, I studied Ridge regression which is one of the most important regressions to overcome overfitting.
<h3>Ridge Regression:</h3>
<p> It is Known as "L2 Regularization". When our best-fit line overfits with the given data point, especially in the training model then the cost function will be zero due to negligible residual error, now to overcome this the ridge regression uses two variables  lambda and square of a slope. the value of lambda is multiplied by the square of the slope and added to the cost function. Now again we have to find the minimal value of the residual of a new best-fit line using a cost function. It penalizes the size of the regression coefficient.</p>

<h1>Day 29</h1>
<b>After learning the algorithm theory of Ridge Regression from Krish Naik's video, today I did the practical implementation of it. I did this on my previous simple linear regression Python code file from 'Day 24'. It was fun to learn the implementation of Ridge after knowing its theory. The code was pretty easy and the model was used from scikit learn which made the learning process so easy and fruitful.</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 31</h1>
<b>After having completed both hyperparameter tuning techniques i.e. Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression in simple linear regression, today, I learned about the concept of Elastic Net Regularization, which is the combination of both ridge and lasso regression. Elastic Net Regression helps in both preventing overfitting and feature selection to find the best-fit line in the model.</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 32</h1>
<b>I believe to complete the basics of simple linear regression from Krish Naik's video. Today, I learned the concept of cross-validation in machine learning. Cross-validation is the mean accuracy of all the accuracies that are valid from the training data itself. When we do cross-validation across the training dataset then we get to know the best accuracy on the dataset which will help in hyperparameter training for the model resulting in low bias and low variance machine learning model</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 33</h1>
<b>After learning theory for many days from YouTube and making notes, today finally I got a chance to implement these theories in practical realms and did so with the help of Krish Naik's video. I used sklearn load_wine() dataset and did up to cross-validation for tuning the model for better accuracy. Similarly, today, I relearned about means squared error, mean absolute error, and square root mse which are one of those important topics in machine learning algorithms.</b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 34</h1>
<b>Today, I completed the practical implementation of simple linear regression with the help of Krish Naik's video. I learned about data preprocessing before feature engineering in machine learning. We should always standardize our dataset so that our model will perform better. Similarly, I had some confusion about 'fit_trasnform' and only 'transform' as to why they are used in different case scenarios. Completing end-to-end ML regression practicals gave me confidence in learning machine learning algorithms. from over mirror, I will probably start learning logistic regression. </b>

<br/>

<h1>Day 35</h1>
<b>Today, I started learning Logistics Regression. Logistics Regression is used to solve  binary classification problems where simple linear regression cannot outshine. When the problem statement is binary classification i.e. 0 and 1 then simple linear regression is not robust to outliners and cannot squash to give the accurate value.so, Logistic regression is used. More about cost function tomorrow. It predicts the value between 0 and 1.</b>
